  *
  *           * Initialize the parameter for  MTPA
  *           * Calculate and output id and iq reference based on torque input
  *           * Calculate and output id based on iq input

/** @defgroup MTPA Maximum Torque Per Ampere Control
  * @brief Maximum Torque Per Ampere (MTPA) Control component of the Motor Control SDK
  *
  *  The torque of the PMSM can be expressed with the equation shown below:
  *
  *  @f[
  *  T_e = \frac{3}{2}\times p \times \phi \times i_q + \frac{3}{2}\times p\times(L_d-L_q)\times i_q\times i_d
  *  @f]
  *
  *    When the motor is a surface mount permanent magnet synchronous motor (SM-PMSM), the @f$ L_d @f$ and @f$ L_q @f$
  *  are almost the same, so only the @f$ i_q @f$ can influence the torque. For internal permanent
  *  magnet synchronous motor (I-PMSM), the @f$ L_d @f$ is not equal to @f$ L_q @f$. Both @f$ i_d @f$ and @f$ i_q @f$ will influence
  *  the torque.
  *    The aim of the MTPA (maximum-torque-per-ampere) control is to calculate the
  *  reference currents which maximize the ratio between produced
  *  electromagnetic torque and copper losses.
  *    The input of this component
  *  is the @f$ i_q @f$ reference. The output of this component is @f$ i_d @f$ reference.
