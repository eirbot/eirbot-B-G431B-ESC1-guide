  * @brief Potentiometer reading component that sets the motor 
  *         speed reference from the potentiometer value
  * 
  *  The Speed Potentiometer component uses the services of the 
  * @ref Potentiometer component to read a potentiometer. Values read
  * from this potentiometer are used to set the rotation speed reference
  * of a motor.
  * 
  *  The state of a Speed Potentiometer component is maintained in a 
  * SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t structure. To use the Speed Potentiometer component, 
  * a SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t structure needs to be instanciated and initialized. 
  * The initialization is performed thanks to the SPDPOT_Init() function. Prior to 
  * calling this function, some of the fields of this structure need to be given a 
  * value. See the Potentiometer_Handle_t and below for more details on this.
  * 
  *  A Speed Potentiometer component sets speed references by executing speed ramps 
  * thanks to the STC_ExecRamp() function. Prior to doing so, the component checks 
  * if the motor is started (that is: if its state machine has reached the #RUN state) 
  * and if its control modality is [Speed](@ref MCM_SPEED_MODE). If either of these
  * conditions is not met, no speed ramp is executed. 
  * 
  *  In addition, a speed ramp is executed only if the value of the potentiometer at 
  * that time differs from the one of the previous ramp that the component filed by 
  * a configurable amount. This amount is gieven by the 
  * @ref SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t::SpeedAdjustmentRange "SpeedAdjustmentRange" field
  * of the Handle structure.
  * 
  *  The speed range accessible through the potentiometer is bounded by a minimum speed 
  * and a maximum speed. the minimum speed is stated at compile time in the 
  * @ref SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t::MinimumSpeed "MinimumSpeed" field of the Handle
  * structure. The maximum speed is deduced from the 
  * @ref SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t::ConversionFactor "ConversionFactor" field thanks to 
  * the following formula: 
  * 
  * $$
  *   MaximumSpeed = \frac{(65536 - MinimumSpeed \times ConversionFactor )}{ConversionFactor}
  * $$
  * 
  * where 65536 is the maximum value that the potentiometer (the ADC actually) can produce.
  *  
  *  The @ref SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t::MinimumSpeed "MinimumSpeed" can be set so that when
  * the potentiometer is set to its minimum value, the motor stil spins. This is useful when 
  * the Motor Control application uses a sensorless speed and position sensing algorithm that
  * cannot work below a given speed.
  * 
  *  The duration of speed ramps is controlled with the @ref SpeedPotentiometer_Handle_t::RampSlope "RampSlope"
  * field of the Handle. This field actually sets the acceleration used to change from one speed
  * to another.
  * 
  *  A potentiometer provides absolute values. A Speed Potentiometer component turns these 
  * values into either positive or negative speed references depending on the actual speed
  * of the motor. So, if a motor is started with a negative speed, the references set by the
  * Speed Potentiometer component targetting it will also be negative.
  * 
  *  Values measured from the potentiometer are expressed in "u16digits": these are 16-bit values directly 
  * read from an ADC. They need to be converted to the [speed unit](#SPEED_UNIT) used by the API 
  * of the motor control library in order to generatethe speed references for the ramps.
  *
  * @note In the current version of the Speed Potentiometer component, the periodic ADC
  * measures **must** be performed on the Medium Frequency Task. This can be done by using
  * the MC_APP_PostMediumFrequencyHook_M1() function of the @ref MCAppHooks service
  * for instance.
